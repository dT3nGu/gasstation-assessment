Assessment task for BigPoint

I've chosen to go with synchronization, waiting and notifying threads as learned at FH Wedel. I am testing with JUnit for exceptions, right amount of revenue, cancelations and number of sales. I am also testing for timing, a certain amount of cars should not wait longer than expected at the station.
